# Watch Face: Zen Digital
A digital watch face that uses the large (built-in) system numeric font
and only displays the time (and other details) on gesture. When the user
is not looking at the watch the entire display will be black. The watch
face utilizes layouts and supports multiple devices. This watch face is
based on ["Big Digital"](https://apps.garmin.com/en-CA/apps/da86e719-1c2d-464b-ba12-8719b6defe56)
and is currently available in the Garmin Connect IQ store as
["Zen Digital"](https://apps.garmin.com/en-CA/apps/1b215d9c-9ea2-41a3-9cff-1391362d8991).
