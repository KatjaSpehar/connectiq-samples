# Watch Faces
All of the projects here are watch faces. You can read more about the Connect IQ
project types on the
["What You Can Build" page](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/what-you-can-build/)
on Garmin's developer site.

However, each project is unique and will likely utilize various features and/or
best practices of Connect IQ and Monkey C. For example, the "Simple Digital" watch
face is an example of using layouts to support multiple devices as well as
support for multiple languages.

## Project Listing

- Simple Digital (simple-digital) : a simple digital watchface
    - layouts
    - multi-device
    - multi-language
