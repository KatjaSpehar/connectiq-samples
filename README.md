# connectiq-samples
Sample apps, libraries and code snippets for use with Garmin's Connect IQ SDK and the Monkey C
programming language.


## Purpose & Goal
The Connect IQ SDK contains a bunch of sample apps which allow you to quickly get started with
Monkey C and covers some common functionality such as rendering images or accessing web resources.
This repo is not necessarily designed to replace those SDKs samples. Instead, this repo should
be used to supplement the samples, covering additional functionality, diving deeping into things
or offering more complete examples. This repo will also house a collection of common functionality
(in the form of quasi libraries and code snippets) with the intent that developers can spend less
writing the same code repetitively and can instead focus on building new, cool apps.


## License
All of the source code within this repo is governed by the license specified by each contributor.
As such, each project should have a LICENSE.txt (or similar file) which contains the text for the
use license. Where no license has been specified it should be assumed the code is in the
public domain. The individual source (and other) files may or may not contain the licensing text.

Contributions are encouraged to use a license with as much flexibility as possible, which currently
is the "MIT License".


## Getting Started
Download or clone the repo and add one, some or all of the projects to your Eclipse workspace.
Read, run, learn and enjoy!


## Repo Details
The repo is broken into 6 sections; one section for each of the different project types (app, data
field, watch face and widget) plus a section for "libraries" and a section for "code snippets".

### Apps
The 'apps' section contains various examples of Connect IQ apps.

### Data Fields
The 'datafields' section contains various examples of Connect IQ data fields, which are added to data screens
on activities built into the various devices.

### Watch Faces
The 'watchfaces' section is for Connect IQ watch faces.

### Widgets
The 'widgets' section is for Connect IQ widgets.

### Libraries
The 'libraries' section contains working code for common functionality and is designed to be added to
other projects. These libraries are typically larger in code size (more than a single function and/or
span multiple files) and will not run as a standalone project. For example, there may be a contributed
library for a fancy menu that combines text and icons.

### Code Snippets
The 'snippets' section contains useful snippets (small chunks) of code to accomplish commonly
required things, such as creating a dynamic menu object or an efficient way to calculate the distance
between two points.


## Contributing
Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file for details on how contribute.
